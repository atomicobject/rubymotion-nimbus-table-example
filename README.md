# RubyMotion and the Nimbus table view

Recently, I wished I had a more complete example of how the [Nimbus library](http://docs.nimbuskit.info/) makes dealing with a [UITableView](http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#documentation/uikit/reference/UITableView_Class/Reference/Reference.html) easier. This example was created in response to that fruitless search.

## Requirements

To run this example you'll need:
* RubyMotion -- confirmed with v.26 but it may work with earlier versions
* Ruby 1.9.3

## To run it

1. Clone the repository
2. cd to the directory
   * There is an `.rvmrc` file -- use it if you like
3. Run `bundle install`
4. Run `rake` to start the app in the simulator
